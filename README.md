# weather-app-tui
TUI Weather app built in go.

## Why?
I have made this project for 2 main reasons:
 - I have been wanting to learn go for a little while now and this seemed like something fun to make
 - I also have been wanting to make something TUI based, and something I would find usefull. A weather app seemed like a good idea for me

## How?
This is how I am making this project:
 - I am making this using VSCode on Ubuntu 24.04LTS.
 - I have decided to use tview for the TUI library as it seems to fit my needs.
 - I am attempting to follow Go file structures but as this is my first project I cannot guarantee a clean and easy to understand project. I used (this project)[https://github.com/Skarlso/gtui] as a reference to how to do this.

## Building
No steps are avalible at this time as I have only just started using go.
