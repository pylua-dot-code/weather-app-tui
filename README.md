# weather-app-tui
TUI Weather app built in go.

## Why?
I have made this project for 2 main reasons
 - I have been wanting to learn go for a little while now and this seemed like something fun to make
 - I also have been wanting to make something TUI based, and something I would find usefull. A weather app seemed like a good idea for me

## How?
I am making this using VSCode on Ubuntu 24.04LTS.

I have decided to use tview for the TUI library as it seems to fit my needs.

## Building:
No steps are avalible at this time as I have only just started using go.
